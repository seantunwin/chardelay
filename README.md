Delay each item in an array to be written to the screen.

Options that you are able to edit:
   * var `str`
   * var `arr`
   * var `obj` can be either `str` or `arr`.
   * var `direction` can be 'h' or 'v'.
   * var `delay` can be changed to any number greater than zero. The default delay is in the `init()` function and set to 1s for vertical and 150ms for horizontal.
